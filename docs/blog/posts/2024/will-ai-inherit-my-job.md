# Will Artificial Intelligence Inherit My Job?

During the summer of 2018, as is common in the military, I was assigned a new role that required rapid skill development to be done by last Friday. As is not so common in the military, that skill was coding; and I was instantly hooked :nerd:

Work wasn't "work" anymore: it was adventure; it was exploration; it was discovery. I fondly remember the penny-drop moment when I wrote some code that looped and printed a statement ten-thousand times in an instant! The realised potential was exhilarating.

## The Advent of AI in Coding

There were two significant moments when I realised change was on our doorstep:

1. A demo in 2022 of an early version of Github Copilot. You typed what you wanted the code to do and then watched as it magically generated before your eyes. I remember thinking that we had automated away the fun part of coding! Ironically, I have grown to love Github Copilot and often use it as an autocomplete for my thought process :shushing_face: But it does still fall over with new features of languages/frameworks—AI is only as up-to-date as its training data.

2. The first time I held a technical conversation with ChatGPT and the weight of what that meant. It helped me understand a new concept I was grappling with. I was able to validate my comprehension (or lack thereof) by repeating the concept back in my own words and having ChatGPT confirm or correct my understanding.

## Contemplating the Future

This all leads to the question on my mind: _if Artificial Intelligence can be so good at technical creation in this premature stage, will it eventually inherit my job of actually writing code?_

I don't actually know the answer to this. I'm not sure anyone does...yet. If the past has taught us anything it's that the future is hard to predict. But I think it's important to contemplate potential outcomes.

Over the next 5-10 years I can imagine Artificial Intelligence taking on a role comparable to an aircraft's autopilot system: it'll do most of the heavy lifting but won't be trusted to do it unconditionally. Pilots in aircraft often do very little actual flying. They usually control take-off and landing. Then for the rest of the flight they monitor, make adjustments if required and—most importantly—are fully trained to take control in case of emergencies.

A day in my future dev-life might look like this:

1. Tell AI to generate feature X to solve problem Y
1. Look over generated code—and its related tests, of course—to verify it works as intended. If not, adjust and repeat step 1 :warning: _potential infinite loop for a stubborn mind_ :warning:
1. If all is well, merge code into codebase
1. If all is not well, oil programming hinges and put fingers to keyboard like I did in the good old days. Maybe ask ChatGPT to help...ahem

The human will have moved from a person who creates, to a person who guides: mastering the art of leveraging the AI to generate vast quantities of code that links seamlessly to the existing codebase. Teams could end up moving at a pace we can only dream of currently.

It's important to remember that AI code is generated by models trained mostly on publicly availably code from sites such as Github. There is best-practice code on Github. The "ideal" training material for AI. There is also hacky code on there, from devs who just need to solve a small problem fast, or who are following tutorials, or are tinkering and learning by making mistakes and seeing what happens (you get the idea). _AI learns from one as much as the other_. But I don't think that's a bad thing: future AI could adjust the style of its generated code based on the "level" of code in the rest of the codebase. This could ensure it complies to a company's code standards or simply the level of comprehension that the coder has.

But what about further into the future? When AI can be creative intentionally, instead of [on the back of hallucinations](https://www.smartcompany.com.au/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-ceo-sam-altman-ai-hallucinations/). When it can generate production-ready code consistently. Could devs be out of a job? :face_with_monocle:

## Ethical Considerations and Innovation

My gut tells me that some companies will give it a go. If there is a buck to be made someone will want to be the first to prove it. The obvious attraction to this dystopian future—_I still love to write code; I am biased_—is money saved when you bin off your engineering team.

When considering any future decision, it's wise to contemplate the consequences too. So what might happen if coders are no longer "needed"?

Programming languages have "Core Devs": teams of people who maintain, update and improve the programming languages themselves. Their most important job is implementing security patches. They also fix bugs, improving usability etc. If AI inherits developer jobs, will it inherit the job of a core dev too? Being responsible for the very code that it generates. (Can AI be given responsibility? Or is that just giving responsibility to the people who made the AI :face_with_raised_eyebrow:)

Maybe AI will do away with the need for programming languages and default to writing [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code)? Arguably, all languages are designed to be human-readable and add overhead as a result. If a human doesn't need to read it, then why bother? You'll get more efficient code.

I hope this **never** happens—no matter the autonomy given to a system, we should always be able to verify what it's doing and why.

How will innovation fare? Innovation is usually driven by determined people who are convinced they know how and why something needs to change. They often face large amounts of push back until the world either accepts the inevitable or gets onboard with the idea. Will AI ever be able to isolate and realise innovative potential in the world? Could its innovations be as impactful as the lightbulb, the telephone or the internet? Will these innovations be a result of hit and miss hallucinations? Or will the AI be able to understand how the innovation would benefit mankind and the far-reaching impact of its implementation on different communities and countries?

Maybe human innovation will flourish! Is there a world ahead of us where AI takes on so much of the mundane that humans are freed from the repetitive and empowered to innovate full-time? Could my job as a dev become one of AI-empowered innovation?

The future is a mystery. Questions abound more than answers. This may always be the case. How AI will change my role as a software developer is up for debate. I hope the changes feel like improvements to those it affects.

Either way, I'm excited to see what happens!
