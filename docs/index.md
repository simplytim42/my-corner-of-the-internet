### Welcome! Thank you for visiting :heart_eyes:

### I'm [Tim MacKay](./about.md), improvising my own path in software development. No traditional degreeâ€”just a passion for coding, computer science and self-improvement.

### As I study, I publish what I learn. These writings help me learn and I hope they can help you too!
