### Before 2018

In 2009, I embarked on my journey with the Royal Air Force as an Aeronautical Cartographer, immersing myself deeply in the realm of Aeronautical Data :airplane:. While this document is dedicated to showcasing my career in Software Development, which commenced in earnest in 2018 (see above :material-arrow-up:), I'd like to provide a brief outline of the skills and experiences acquired in this trade that I believe have significantly enhanced my capabilities as a Developer:

- Maintained a database of flight procedures for autopilot systems
- Implemented over two hundred QA data checks using SQL that led to the improvement of tens of thousands of data records :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- Spearheaded a pivot to focus heavily on satellite-based flight procedures :satellite_orbital:, enabling RAF squadrons to embrace modern aviation practices
- Conducted QA checks on aeronautical charts generated from data
- Created technical documentation :bookmark: to aid colleagues and improve data quality
